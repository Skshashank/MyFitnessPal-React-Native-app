Building our very own food tracking app, kind of like MyFitnessPal! We're using React Native, Expo, Expo Router, and IBM StepZen for this project. The app will help you search for and log your meals, and it will give you all the details on calories and macros. We'll integrate the Food and Grocery Database API to make food tracking super easy.
